# Overview

In my pursuit as a software engineer, I am dedicated to continual learning. My current focus involves mastering C++ and enhancing my proficiency in C#, aiming to solidify my foundation and uncover new opportunities for growth within the realm of software development.

The presented code represents a basic C# application, named "HelloWorld." Within this simple program, the Console.WriteLine method is employed to output the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console. This brief yet foundational example serves as an introduction to the fundamental structure of a C# console application.

The purpose of creating this simple "HelloWorld" C# program is to refresh my memory on C# from my class a few semesters ago. This straightforward example serves as a quick and practical way to revisit the basic syntax and structure of C#, providing a refresher on fundamental concepts learned in the past.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to develop and run the C# program, leveraging its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with the .NET Core compiler. Git provided version control, and the terminal in Visual Studio Code facilitated quick program execution and testing. This efficient toolkit contributed to a streamlined development process.
